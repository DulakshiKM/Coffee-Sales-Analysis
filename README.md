# Coffee Sales Analysis

This Power BI dashboard provides coffee shop owners with insights into sales patterns and trends within their establishments.

By leveraging this analysis, shop owners can efficiently pinpoint top-performing and underperforming products, discern sales patterns and future projections, monitor the growth trajectory of their businesses, identify peak hours and days of activity, and assess the performance of each store location.

With these insights, owners can make informed decisions regarding menu adjustments, introduce new products tailored to customer preferences, and proactively prepare for peak hours to minimize customer wait times.
